I am in the mood
I got the juice, I pay my [?]
Please don't @ me, tag me, throw no sub
This a two on two
Try to guard me, but I switch it up
I got some different moves
Same shit, new day, new friends, new bae
You can't buy my style on eBay
No, this is something new
Whoa, you can't wear this shoe
Yeah, I won't let you rise even in a Yeezy Boost
Yeah, I moonwalk like M.J
Miss no shots like M.J
Take them to school like L.J
Do this for style like Kim K
What they gon' say?
If I motivate, I get jump up out my way
Be real and never fake
I'm true talk in my ways
Why you be frontin' like you got something you don't
Come on

Tell your man right now
I'm not with the hype now
I do what I like now
What you see is what you get from me

What it look like
Yeah, everything is just what it look like
Yeah, money in the bank
That's a good life
Yeah, everything I got is mine, no hype
No hype, no hype
What it look like
Yeah, everything is just what it look like
Yeah, money in the bank
That's a good life
Yeah, everything I got is mine, no hype
No hype, no hype

[Dax:]
Yeah, this all real, no hype
My light shine so bright
L.E.D., we lit
Yeah, my shit shine tonight
Used to chill in the back, I was out of sight
Now these niggas wishin' they can come
And try and live my life
Yeah, real nigga can't go back
Ice on my neck, hold the check, the Patek
Hold the flex, to the man, the game, and all rack
Yeah, real nigga, they know that
Came in the game with a bang [?]
And then Dax always up on the track, track, track
Yeah, we rock and we roll
My day 1's, they know (They know)
I won't lose control (Ol, ol, ol)
